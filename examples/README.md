# Initial steps
- Copy 'configure.ac', 'Makefile.in' and 'Envs.in' files to the root directory of your project.
- Copy 'config_h.rs.in' file to the 'src' directory of your project.
- Create directory 'tests' in the root directory of your project, then copy the 'requirements.txt' file to just created 'tests' dir.
- Use 'configure.sh' to generate Makefile.
